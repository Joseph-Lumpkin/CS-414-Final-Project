Squibb is a Task Management Application that can be used by groups
of people to help manage their projects and collaborate effectively
in a team environment.

Users can sign in with a Google account, join a group and poof. They're ready
to collaborate as a member or manager.

Login:
	* Use a Google account to sign up or login.

Creating and joining a group:
	* Users can create a group.
	* Users can invite other users to their group by providing a group code and 
	  password. Admins and owners of the groups can view the password.

Leaving or disbanding a group:
	* Users can leave a group by visiting the group page,
	  tapping the options icon in the top right corner, and selecting leave group.
	* Owners of a group can either pass ownership to another member
	  and quit normally, or disband the group.
	* Disbanding a group will remove all members and delete the group permanently.

Managing Roles and Permissions:
	* Owners of a group can assign roles for the members in the group.



For Developers:
	To get the Android side running, the developer will need the 
	google-services.json and the API key found outside of this repo.
